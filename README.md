# Depression Classification Using Federated Learning

This project implements a text classification model to predict depression using federated learning techniques. Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras within a Jupyter Notebook environment, the model is trained across multiple datasets, ensuring data privacy by keeping data localized.

## Project Structure

- `Depression_Classification_Federated_Learning.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire implementation, including data preprocessing, model creation, federated learning training loops, and evaluation.
- `data1.csv`, `data2.csv`, `data3.csv`: CSV files containing the datasets used for training the model. Each dataset should have two columns: `text` (the textual data) and `label` (binary labels where `0` indicates non-depression and `1` indicates depression).
- `global_text_model.h5`: The final global model saved after federated learning iterations.
- `README.md`: This README file providing instructions and details about the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Keras (bundled with TensorFlow)

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyter tensorflow pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

Each dataset undergoes the following preprocessing steps:

- **Lowercasing**: Convert all text data to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
- **Removing Special Characters and URLs**: Eliminate non-alphanumeric characters and URLs to clean the data.
- **Splitting Data**: Divide each dataset into training and testing subsets.

### Step 2: Federated Learning

- **Tokenization and Padding**: Convert textual data into sequences of integers and pad them to a consistent length for model compatibility.
- **Model Initialization**: Create a global text classification model architecture using Keras' Sequential API.
- **Client Simulation**: Simulate three clients, each training the model on its local dataset.
- **Weight Averaging**: After local training, average the weights from all clients to update the global model, emulating the federated learning process.

### Step 3: Model Evaluation

- **Dataset Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the global model on a specific dataset by calculating metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Custom Text Prediction**: Test the model's prediction capability on individual text examples to observe its practical effectiveness.

### Step 4: Saving and Loading the Model

- **Model Saving**: After training, save the global model as `global_text_model.h5` for future use.
- **Model Loading**: Load the saved model to perform evaluations or make predictions without retraining.


## Project Notes

- **Tokenization Consistency**: The tokenizer used during training is essential for preprocessing during evaluation and testing. Ensure consistency by reusing the same tokenizer or saving and loading it if the notebook is restarted.

- **Parameter Tuning**: Feel free to adjust hyperparameters such as `vocab_size`, `embedding_dim`, `max_length`, and the number of federated learning iterations to better suit your datasets and improve model performance.

- **Error Handling**: The data loading section includes try-except blocks to handle potential errors. Review any printed errors to ensure datasets are correctly formatted and accessible.
